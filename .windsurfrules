# Estate DAO Frontend Agent Guidelines

## Build/Test Commands
- Build: `bash scripts/local_run.sh`
- Type Check: `bash scripts/local_check.sh` 
- Run with Mocks: `./scripts/local_run_with_mock.sh`
- Single Test: `cargo test --lib <test_name> -- --nocapture`

## Code Style
- Use Rust 2021 edition
- Format imports: Group by crate, with `use crate` imports first
- Leptos component props use `#[prop(into)]` pattern when accepting signals
- Mark props as `#[prop(optional)]` when they have defaults
- Use `RwSignal` for state that changes, `Signal` for read-only state
- Callbacks use `Callable::call(&callback, args)` pattern
- Use descriptive documentation comments for public functions/structs
- Error handling: Prefer `anyhow` for errors, with `error-stack` for context
- Mobile compatibility changes should only use CSS changes (per .windsurfrules)


## Workflow to achieve desired outcome from code

1. gather required context by searching functions / code paths / related files
2. plan the changes in a markdown file
3. code changes should be based on tasks broken down in step 2. and should not break existing functionality
4. run `bash scripts/local_check.sh` to check for type errors
5. write a short note on lessons learnt in lessons_learnt.md
